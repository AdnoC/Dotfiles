A list of my dotfiles. Mainly for self reference and in order to access them
anywhere.

A lot of stuff here was taken from other dotfile repositories on github,
I don't take credit for any well written sections of the files here.

## Instalation Instructions
    git clone https://github.com/AdnoC/Dotfiles.git
Then just open vim and let it automatically install the plugins.
NOTE: If you do not have ctags installed it will not install the vim plugin 'tagbar'
